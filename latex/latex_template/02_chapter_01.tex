\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What is an Embedde System?}
  An emmbedde system is a \textbf{combination of hardware and software} (firmware) embedded into the hardware. 
  Usually an embedded system is a microcontroller or a microporcessor system, sometimes connected to external peripherals (like sensors or mechanical parts), designed to perform a specific task. 

\subsection{Classification}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\textbf{Stand-Alone}: they operate idependently (no external connections: internet), taking inputs processing them and producing an output. Inputs can be from electric signals or user interactions and outputs may be electric signals or a visual feedback.}
    \item {\textbf{Real-Time}: they are systems that must complete specific tasks within a defined time period, depending on the type (Hard or Soft [TODO insert chapter]) missing a deadline can be catastrophic.}
    \item {\textbf{Networked Information Appliances}: a system designe to connect to a network and exchange informations. They form what is called the \textbf{Internet of things \textemdash IOT}, a network of sensors and actuators with software and hardware to exchange data over the internet.}
    \item {\textbf{Mobile Devices}: they are a special category of embedded systems, including smartphones, tablets and devices using a varaiety of tecnologies such as 5G, Wi\textemdash Fi and nowdays AI tecnologies. Though being general purpose they need to be threated as an embedded systems.}
  \end{itemize}
