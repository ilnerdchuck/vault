# Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)
Asks whether there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula.
It is possible to find an assignment of (non-contradicting) boolean values to variables which satisfies the formula (so it returns 1), setting at least one literal in each clause to ‘1’?
