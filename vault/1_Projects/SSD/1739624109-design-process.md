# Design Process

There are 3 steps to design an embedded system:
 - **(Design) Validation**: making sure that the design is consistent with 
 the original specification
 - **(Implementation) Verification**: making sure that the implementation
 is consistent with the design of the validation phase.
 - **Manifacturing Verification-Test**: Making sure that the manifactured
 product is consistent with the implemented design of the verification phase
