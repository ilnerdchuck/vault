A multi-core processor (MCP) is a microprocessor on a single integrated circuit (IC) with two or more 
separate central processing units (CPUs), called cores to emphasize their multiplicity (for example, 
dual-core or quad-core). Each core reads and executes program instructions, 
specifically ordinary CPU instructions (such as add, move data, and branch).
The MCP can run instructions on separate cores at the same time, increasing 
overall speed for programs that support [[1740667904-multithreading|Multithreading]] or other [[1740667914-parallel-computing|Parallel Computing]] techniques.
