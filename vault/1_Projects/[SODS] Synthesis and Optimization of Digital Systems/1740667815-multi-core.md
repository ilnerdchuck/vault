A multi-core processor (MCP) is a microprocessor on a single integrated circuit (IC) with two or more 
separate central processing units (CPUs), called cores to emphasize their multiplicity (for example, 
dual-core or quad-core). Each core reads and executes program instructions, 
specifically ordinary CPU instructions (such as add, move data, and branch).
The MCP can run instructions on separate cores at the same time, increasing 
overall speed for programs that support [[1740667904-multithreading|Multithreading]] or other [[1740667914-parallel-computing|Parallel Computing]] techniques.

- Many cores interconnected 
- May share resurces
- May rely on Multithreading (MT)
    - Classical MT (Time Division Multiplexing)
    - Block MT (Itamium)
        - Bunch of instruction from T.A.?
        - Bunch of instruction from T.B.?
    - Interleaved MT (SPARC)
        - i instruction j from T.A.?
        - i+1 instruction j from T.B.?
        - i+2 instruction j+1 from T.A.?
    - Simultaneous MT or Hyperthreading (Superscalar Ultrasparc T2 and newer intel until ALder lake)
        - i: $j_{TA}$, $k_{TB}$, $l_{TC}$ // we have multiple execution stages so we can execute the istructions jkl in parallel
        - i+1: $j+1_{TA}$, $k+1_{TB}$, $l+1_{TC}$
