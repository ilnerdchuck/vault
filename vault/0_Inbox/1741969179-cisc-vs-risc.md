As DRAM memory was really expansive program using less instructions were more advisable.
Variable length instructions formats allowed the most common instructions to be encoded in 
fewer bits this features are the key points of a [[1740926407-cisc|CISC]]. [[1740926402-risc|RISC]]
architectures were not possible to allocate a high cost for transistors registers.
But ad DRAM and transistor cost lowered having less instructions, fixed instruction length and simpler addressing modes
allowed the RISC architecture to grow in a CISC dominated market. 

But the markes remains devoted to the CISC due to:
 - binary compatibility
 - Hardware is complex but for higher performance can be worth
