General purpose systems are usually based on a Von Neumann Architecture: 
 - **Input/Output**: mechanism to perform operation with external entities
 - **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: which performs the control of the machine and the arithmetic operations ([[1741963894-arithmetic-logic-unit---alu|ALU]])
 - **Memory Unit**: Stores both data and instructions
