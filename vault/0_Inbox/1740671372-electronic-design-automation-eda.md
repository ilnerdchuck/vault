It is a tool suite developed to assist the designers to design electronics systems. 
The tools are designed to fit in the Flow and Method that designers use to design 
and analyze semiconductor chips.

Pro:
 - Optimizations
 - Simulation & Verification
 - Manifacturing Assistance

Issues for an EDA:
 - Design Complexity
 - Many Design Options
    - Many [[1741189049-integration-strategies|Integration Strategies]] (expand)
    - Many [[Technologies]] (Silicon Teconologies? Node Technology?)
        - Si-MOS
        - [[1740671504-fd-soi|FD-SOI]]
        - [[1740693829-finfet|FinFET]] 
        - Silicon Nanowires
    - Many [[Design Styles]] (expand)
 - Be User Friendly
 - Tools need to be Fast and Accurate => Scalability
