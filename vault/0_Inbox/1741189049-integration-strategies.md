- System on Board (SoB)
    - Low cost
    - but Low Performance
        - Huge parasitic capacitance
        - Long interconnections
- System on Package (SoP)
    - Less Parasitic Capacitance
    - Lower power
    - High Performance
    - Higher Cost
- System On Chip (SoC)
    - 3d-Ics => vertical placement done via TSV (expand)
    - Very High cost 
    - Low power 
    - Super high Performance
    - Temperature now is a big issue
