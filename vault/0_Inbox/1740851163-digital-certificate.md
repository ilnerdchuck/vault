A digital certificate is a digital document that links a pair of keys 
to an actor. They are released and digitally signed by a certification 
authority after a specific procedure: 
 - A certificate has an expiration date (issue in embedded system due to not so frequent 
 updates)
 - A certificate can be revoked (issue in embedded system as it is not always connected)
 - They are usually released in X.509 format
