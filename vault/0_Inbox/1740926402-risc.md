# RISC
RISC 
    - Low number of instructions 
    - fixed length? What does it mean? All architectures have fixed length instructions 
    - Simpler addressing mode
    - Simpler and faster Hardware 
    - Uniform complexity 
    - Larger number of registers
    - Binary compatibility?: ability for the binary to be run on an another microP with the same arch
    - bad bandwidth to memory managment
