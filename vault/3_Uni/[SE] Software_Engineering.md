this things under are  Development phase
Bottom-up

Production Activities
- Requirement Engineering => Requirement Document
- Architecture Design => Design Document
- Implementation => Units
- Integrate unit => System
![production_activities_chain.png](assets/imgs/production_activities_chain.png)
each activity is dependent on the previous one

Validation and Verification Activity (V&V) 
 - Are requirements correct?
    - Externally: did the document contains what the customer or user wants?
    - Internally: Is the document consistent?
 - Is the design correct?
    - Externally: is the design fulfilling the requirements?
    - Internally: is the design consistent?
 - Is the code correct?
    - Externally: is the code fulfilling the requirements and the design?
    - Internally: Is the code consistent from a syntactic point of view?
Production with V&V:

As we can see we expand the previous process Activities producing the same products 
but with less defects
