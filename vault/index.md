How i plan to structure my garden:
It's a mix between the PARA method and Zettelkasten.

 - [[inbox]] contains all temp notes to be moved in other states
 - Projects: short term tasks (6 months)
 - [[areas]]: Long term (Lifetime) projects
 - Uni: containts files that are indexes with some explenation
   between them (like a classic latex note would be), but in this way 
   the basic components are kept in the resurces state 
 - [[resurces]]: pool of Atomic notes (Zettelkasten)
 - [[journal|Journal]]: is to keep track of which notes i created on what day
 - [[archive|Archive]]: all notes that i consider not usefoul anymore or not suited for 
   the other states 

choose color codes for:
 - atomic note
 - content of an atomic note 
 - project note 
 - color for a note to be placed in a index note of the course

Steps for a new uni course could be:
make big classic note during the semester and menawhile extract atomic notes 

Types of notes:
 - Source note: main note to reference all other notes
    - sits in projects/uni until the 

note structure:
 - title: title to display
 - tags: macro arera of intrest of the note (Ex. VHDL, c++) specific
    but not too mutch, a tag that is shared among more notes
 - bottom:
    - References: used to link other related topics
