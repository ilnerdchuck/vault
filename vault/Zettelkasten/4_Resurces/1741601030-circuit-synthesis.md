It is the generation of a structural view from a behavioral one 

 - **Architectural level synthesis**: Determine tha macroscopic structure 
 - **Logic level synthesis**: Determine the microscopic structure 
 - **Circuit level synthesis**: Determine positions and connection of physical primitives 

## Synthesis and Optimization
Synthesis **must** be paired with optimization technique, otherwise it has no meaning. 
Designers aim to:
 - Have better performance
    - Frequency
    - [[1741601550-latency|Latency]]
    - [[1741601535-throughput|Throughput]]
 - Low energy consumption
 - Smaller IC area 
 - Testability

this objectives can only be achieved win optimization
