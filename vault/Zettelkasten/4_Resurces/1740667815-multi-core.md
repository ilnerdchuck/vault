A multi-core processor (MCP) is a microprocessor on a single integrated circuit (IC) with two or more 
separate interconnected central processing units (CPUs), called cores to emphasize their multiplicity (for example, 
dual-core or quad-core). Each core reads and executes program instructions, 
specifically ordinary CPU instructions (such as add, move data, and branch).

The MCP can run instructions on separate cores at the same time, increasing 
overall speed for programs that support [[1740667904-multithreading|Multithreading]] or other [[1740667914-parallel-computing|Parallel Computing]] techniques.

The CPU topology can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous.
There are many differences among the possible implementations: programming detail, hardware configuration
and speedup potential. Most differences develop from a variety of shared hardware, especially the way the 
processor share memory. Some examples could be:
 - shared internal logic, shared data cache and shared memory
 - shared data cache-shared memory
 - separate data cache but shared bus-shared memory 
 - separate  data cache with separate buses leading to a shared memory
 - separate processor and separate memory modules interconnected with a multistage interconnection 
 network 
 - separate processor-memory systems cooperatively executing applications via a network 

# Summary 

- Many cores interconnected => [[1740681847-network-on-a-chip|Network on a Chip]]
- May share resurces
- May rely on Multithreading (MT)
    - Classical MT (Time Division Multiplexing)
    - Block MT (Itamium)
        - Bunch of instruction from T.A.?
        - Bunch of instruction from T.B.?
    - Interleaved MT (SPARC)
        - i instruction j from T.A.?
        - i+1 instruction j from T.B.?
        - i+2 instruction j+1 from T.A.?
    - Simultaneous MT or Hyperthreading (Superscalar Ultrasparc T2 and newer intel until ALder lake)
        - i: $j_{TA}$, $k_{TB}$, $l_{TC}$ // we have multiple execution stages so we can execute the istructions jkl in parallel
        - i+1: $j+1_{TA}$, $k+1_{TB}$, $l+1_{TC}$
