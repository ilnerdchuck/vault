title: Parallel Computing
---

Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously. 
Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. 
Parallelism and concurrency are two different things: a parallel program uses multiple CPU cores, 
each core performing a task independently. On the other hand, concurrency enables a program to deal with multiple tasks even on a single CPU core
