It is a design based on Gate Arrays (GA), they are a predefined base cell 
that are interconnected to form logic functions which can be personalized 
and connected: 
- Pre-Diffused arrays:
    - [[1741597178-mask-programmable-gate-arrays-mpgas|Mask-Programmable Gate-Arrays (MPGAs)]]
    - personalization by metalization/contacts
- Pre-Wired arrays:
    - personalization  on the field 
    - [[1740682029-fpga|Field Programmable Gate-Arrays (FPGA)]] 

The cells not yet programmed are called **uncommitted cell**, once they are 
programmed they became a **committed call**.

They offer slower performance but the design time is lower compared to a full
