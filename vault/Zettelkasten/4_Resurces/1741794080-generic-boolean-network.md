# Generic Boolean Network

Nodes: local functions 
Edges: interconnections of local funcitons 

for each node ($v_i$):
- $d_i$ => delay of the node 
- $a_i$ => area of the node

=> This informations can be taken from an approximation of a delay/area model
    - Ex the number of inputs:
    - $d_i$ => number of inputs 
    - $a_i$ => number of inputs
