- KISS: avoids Accidental complexity (complexity not needed by the requirements), 
the simpler solution is in most cases the correct one. 

- Separation of concerns: divide a large problem in smaller problems and solve them first.

- Abstractions: Extract a model that describes the system avoiding unneeded details and then 
reason on the model and not on the reality.
