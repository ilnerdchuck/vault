The basic structure of an FPGA is composed on the following elements: 
 - Logic Blocks (CLB):
    - [[1740863690-look-up-tables-lut|Look Up Tables (LUT)]]: 
    - [[1739451079-flip-flop|Flip-Flop]]: register to store the result of the LUT
 - Memories: distributed RAMs
 - Interconnections: wires to connect inputs and outputs to logic blocks
 - I/O blocks: special blocks at the periphery of the device for external connections

It is an IC that is based on an array of interconncted cells (CLB), each of them performs
a logic function

# Types of Personalization
 - Soft: By programming a memory cell
 - Hard: by programming an anti-fuse (Permanent)
