# State Reduction

The state reduction minimizes the [[1739365679-state-diagram|state diagram]] by removing [[1739362540-equivalent-state|equivalent states]], when two states are equivalent one of them can be removed. This is usefoul 
becouse it simplifies the final machine by reducing the number of [[1739451079-flip-flop|Flip-Flops]]
required for the design.
