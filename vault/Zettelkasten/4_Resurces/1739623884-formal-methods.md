# Formal Methods

Methods to apply mathematical logic to develop systems that are correct:
 - Validation: 
 > Are we building the right system?
 
 Validation usually can be done only dynamically, i.e., the product is tested by putting it through typical and atypical usages ("Does it satisfactorily meet all use cases?"). 

 - Verification:
 > Are we building the system right?
 
 Verification is one aspect of testing a product's fitness for purpose. The verification process consists of static/structural and dynamic/behavioral aspects. E.g., for a software product one can inspect the source code (static) and run against specific test cases (dynamic). 

the porpuse of the formal methods is not to replace a [[1739626759-simulation|Simulation]] phase but rather 
to spot the test vectors which generates the error.
