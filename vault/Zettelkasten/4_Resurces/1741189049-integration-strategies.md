    - Low cost
    - but Low Performance
        - Huge parasitic capacitance
        - Long interconnections
- [[1741595453-system-on-package-sop|System on Package (SoP)]] 
    - Less Parasitic Capacitance
    - Lower power
    - High Performance
    - Higher Cost
- [[1740667320-system-on-chip-soc|System on Chip (SoC)]]
    - 3d-Ics => vertical placement done via TSV (expand)
    - Very High cost 
    - Low power 
    - Super high Performance
    - Temperature now is a big issue
