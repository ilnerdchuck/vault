Hardware acceleration is the use of computer hardware designed to perform specific functions more efficiently when compared to software running on a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU). Any transformation of data that can be calculated in software running on a generic CPU can also be calculated in custom-made hardware, or in some mix of both.

We call the cores dataflow cores

So using the transistor/CPUs in an efficient way
- with Parallel Computing 
- by using accelerators
we gain 
- Control Locality 
- Data Locality
