# Locality Of Reference

In computer science, locality of reference, also known as the principle of locality, 
is the tendency of a processor to access the same set of memory locations repetitively 
over a short period of time. There are two basic types of reference locality â€“ temporal 
and spatial locality. Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data and/or 
resources within a relatively small time duration. Spatial locality (also termed data locality) 
refers to the use of data elements within relatively close storage locations. 
Sequential locality, a special case of spatial locality, occurs when data elements 
are arranged and accessed linearly, such as traversing the elements in a one-dimensional array.

The systems can benefits from locality:
- Increasing the locality of reference => software side 
- Exploiting the locality of reference => hardware side especially temporal and spatial can be used in hierarchical 
storage hardware.
