Every program has a stack managed with a [[1741624407-last-in-first-out---lifo|Last In First Out - LIFO]] policy:
 - **Push**: Adds item to the stack 
 - **Pop**: Pull item from the stack 
 - **Call**: Invoke a section of code stored in memory
 - **Walk**: incrementally read the values in the stack from first in to last in
 - **Trace**: debugging result of executing or calling memory -> GDB trace
