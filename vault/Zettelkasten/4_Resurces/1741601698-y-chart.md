Axes:
 - Structural: How primitives are connected
 - Behavioural: What the circuit does
 - Physical: Geometry and placement of primitives

Circles define the level of details (Closer to the origin means more level):
 - Software: task implemented by CPUs and Memories
 - Architectural: operations implemented by micro resources 
 - RTL logic: boolean equations and storage implemented by Flip-Flops and Gates
 - Circuit: electrical equations implemented by transistors

The intersections are the implementation of the abstraction level at different level 
of detail.

We can move form one axis to another of the chart:
- **Synthesis** [[1741601030-circuit-synthesis|Circuit Synthesis]] => Behavioural -> Structural,  Define the structure of a circuit implementation
- **Physical Synthesis** => Structural -> Physical
    - moving towards the origin we have Floorplan (Plcement of macroblocks) -> placement (internal layout of a macroblock)
    - at the circuit level we need to specify a mos topology
    - the different levels of abstraction are: floorplanning -> Placement -> silicon sopology  
- **Verification** => Structural -> Behavioural

Optimizations can be performed on each intersection of the structural level => it is a model refinement with a 
given cost function. But to reduce the cost function the optimal solution is not one but could be a set: 
we need to find the Pareto optimal implementation: [[1741600246-pareto-curve|Pareto Curve]]. 
They can be applied at the different level of abstractions:
- Logic-Level:
    - minimize area under delay constraints
    - minimize delay under area constraints
- Architecture-level
    - Determine the cycle-time: time taken to complete the production process 
    - minimize area under latency constraints
    - minimize latency under area constraints

The tools are capable of searching into the design space with constraints the possible cost functions solutions
and returns one possible solution: a pareto point (The trivial solution, where we can start exploring the possible solutions)
by iterating on different constraints we can start tracing the pareto curve and find our optimal solution.
