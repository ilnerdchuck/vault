# Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data

In computing, multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) is a technique employed 
to achieve parallelism. Machines using MIMD have a number of processor cores that 
function asynchronously and independently. At any time, different processors may 
be executing different instructions on different pieces of data
