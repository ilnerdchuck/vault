An SoC is an integrated circuit (IC) combining every part of a compute system into a single silicon die. 
This can include one or more central processing units (CPUs) or processors 
(low-powered microcontrollers and/or application processors) each with several cores, 
alongside peripherals like a graphics processing unit (GPU), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or 4G/5G cellular 
modems, memory, and perhaps even storage.
