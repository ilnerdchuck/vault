we could have used a radix to thus lookign sonly 2 bits at the time 
=> changing the radix changes the 

Pro

The more you increase the radix the more bits you see, thus you aare faster but the 
single operations are compkicated an could be slowwe could have used a radix to thus lookign sonly 2 bits at the time 

!!! rifletti sugli input dell'algoritmo (Edge cases)

add the exampple implementation

Keep an eye on how we can generate the shifts of A: now it is an architect  decision on how to implement it 

In respect to other adders we work with the radix 
critical path depends on how the sums or shifters are implemented and how the signals are propagated

could be pipelined 
- register after each sum or whatever i need depends on clock sycle
- but the encoders need to have a skew network/de skew network to keep the correct 
values of B coherent with  the current operation to be done
