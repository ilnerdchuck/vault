> [!DANGER] Cause
> There is a dependency between data processed by two instructions then the pipeline must be stalled:
> we need to wait for the dependency to be executed

For example: 

| Instruction       | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
|--------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| i ADD R1,#5        | IF  | ID  | EX  | MEM | <span style="color:red">**WB**</span>  |     |     |     
| i+1 SUB R1,R2      |     | IF  | ID  | <span style="color:red">**EX**</span>  | MEM | WB  |     |     
| i+2 MUL R6,R7      |     |     | IF  | ID  | EX  | MEM | WB  |     

R1 is needed ad an operand for the $SUB$, thus we need to wait for the ADD to be written back to the 
register file to be used for the $SUB$.
