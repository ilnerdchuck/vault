How i plan to structure my garden:
It's a mix between the PARA method and Zettelkasten, i don't think that the pure Zettelkasten
method is manageable, for the way courses are taught extracting true atomic notes is a bit difficult.

- [[Inbox]] contains all temp notes to be moved in other states
- Projects: short term tasks/projects/Uni active courses (6 months)
- [[Areas]]: Long term (Lifetime) projects
- [[Uni]]: contains files that are indexes for the University courses
 with some explanation between them sometimes (like a classic latex note would be),
 but in this way the basic components are kept in the resources state
- [[Resurces]]: pool of Atomic notes (Zettelkasten)
- [[journal|Journal]]: is to keep track of things maybe (trying to see if it is useful)
- [[archive|Archive]]: all notes that i consider not useful anymore or not suited for
   the other states.

Color codes in case of taking notes externally:

- Atomic note  
- Content of an atomic note
- Project note

Steps for a new uni course could be:

- Make big classic (Index/Uni) note during the semester and meanwhile extract atomic notes

Types of notes:

- Index note: main note to reference all other notes
  - sits in projects/uni until the project/course is concluded/reviewed

Note structure (Template: to be written):

- title: title to display
- tags: macro area of interest of the note (Ex. VHDL, c++) specific
    but not too much, a tag that is shared among more notes
- Bottom:
  - References: links to related topics
