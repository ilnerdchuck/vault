The design space is a space defined by given design variables. 
Each point can be mapped to an **Objective Space** where the 
variables are metrics (Ex delay, cell area, ect..)

Synthesis tools define a solution area, where optimizations can be applied to find 
optimal solutions to given metrics. This can be done by searching the [[1741600246-pareto-curve|Pareto Curve]]
