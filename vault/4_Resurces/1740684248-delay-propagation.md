It is the time taken by a signal to reach a destination point. 
In electronics the destination is given by a signal reachiung a valid state, thus 
becoming stable. In gate logic gates have a **Gate Delay** which is in how much
time the signal becomes stable, usually it is mesured from when the input \
changing to 50% of its final input level, to the output reaching 50% of its final output level; 
this may depend on the direction of the level change, in which case separate fall $t_f$ and rise $t_r$ are given. 

ToDo: 
- add some examples
