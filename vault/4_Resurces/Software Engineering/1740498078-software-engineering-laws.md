- Requirements deficiencies are the prime source of project failures
- Requirements and design cause the majority of defects
- Defects from requirements and design are the more expensive to fix
- Modularity, hierarchical structures allow to manage complexity
- Reuse guarantees higher quality and lower cost, don't redo what it 
is already done (Best for Design)
- Good designs require deep application domain knowledge => the designer experience 
in the field is related to the quality of the end design 
- Testing can show the presence of defects not their absence 
    - Test should be done by an external entity, maybe the developer can't spot all the 
    defects
- A system that is used changes 
    - A system in constant usage and updates will grow in complexity if not controlled 
        - Ex Architecture erosion => in architecture you fix the design of a building 
        - Requirements creep?
        - Refactoring => changing the design without changing the functionalities

Project management: 
    - Developer productivity is not always constant 
    - As the size of the project size increases the eee growsn non linearly  
    - Adding features or properties while developing the project extends it's developing time 
    - the process should be adapted to the object
