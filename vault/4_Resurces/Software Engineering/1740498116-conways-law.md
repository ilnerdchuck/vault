Conway's Law describes the correlation between the structure of the organization and the system they design:
    - Organizational Structure => the structure should mirror how the members work together 
    - Information Systems => information systems part will reflect the organizational structure
    - Software Projects => module interfaces will reflect team's structure 
As an Organization produce a design it will mimic the communication structure of the Organization itself.
